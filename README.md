# Caesar Cipher

## Description

This project is a console cipher program that uses the caesar method, that encodes or decodes messages using displacement. The uset can encode or decode a message, usign a certaing displacement. 
A simple example would be, i choose a displacement of 1, and enter "hello" as message, i get "ifmmp". The same will be if i decide to decode "ifmmp" with that displacement value, i will get "hello" back. The program can go both directions, encoding and decoding using the Caesar Method.
